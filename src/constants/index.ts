const INTRODUCTION = " Corsi task is a psychological test that is used to measure your visual-spatial short-term working memory. In this test, you have to mark the blocks that change color in order on the screen in the same order. The block sequence starts simple, but it gets more complex until your performance drops. This game shows how well your brain processes and stores visual information. In our application, the number of blocks will always remain the same, but the number of blocks you need to mark will increase up to 9. This way, you can also test your backward memory ability."
